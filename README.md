## Description
### What is this?

A quiz game made using JavaScript to:
- Traverse the DOM to select and programmatically display elements using event handlers.
- Set a timer and end the game once the timer has expired.
- Save scores in the browser's local storage for later access.
- Structure data for ease of access and readability.
